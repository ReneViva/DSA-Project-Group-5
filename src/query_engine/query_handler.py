# ======================= QUERY ENGINE =======================
# This file manages CRUD operations and range queries.
# Steps:
# 1. Define functions: insert_record(), delete_record(), update_record(), search_record()
# 2. Connect these functions to the data_store and AVL trees
# 3. Implement range_query() using AVL traversal
# 4. Optionally track performance times for testing
# Purpose: Handle all user queries and return results efficiently.
