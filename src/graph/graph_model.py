# ======================= GRAPH MODEL =======================
# This file builds a graph structure representing relationships in the dataset.
# Steps:
# 1. Create nodes (e.g., developers, publishers)
# 2. Add edges for collaborations or relationships
# 3. Use NetworkX Graph for implementation
# 4. Provide methods to build and access the graph
# Purpose: Prepare the graph layer for running algorithms like BFS/DFS later.
