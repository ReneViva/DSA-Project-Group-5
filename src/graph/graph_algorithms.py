# ======================= GRAPH ALGORITHMS =======================
# This file implements algorithms to analyze the graph created in graph_model.py.
# Steps:
# 1. Implement BFS and DFS traversals
# 2. Add shortest_path(), connected_components(), or clustering functions
# 3. Use NetworkX methods where needed
# 4. Optionally visualize with matplotlib or plotly
# Purpose: Extract insights and relationships between nodes in the dataset.
